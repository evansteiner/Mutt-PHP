# Mutt-PHP v0.1
Mutt-PHP is micro-framework I built for for fast prototyping of small PHP applications. It's intentionally small to limit complexity, but isn't strongly recommended for a production-level app. 

## Highlights
- MVC
- Autoloading
- Simple routing 
- Optional HTML scaffolding 
- Built-in profiler
- Designed to be extended
